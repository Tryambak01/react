Theres two ways to create react-app , 
1) npx create-react-app appname , this takes a lot of time.
2) npm create vite@latest  , (vite is a bundler) (also you have to install each thing from here , to do that do npm i)

package.json file is the heart of the project , here you can check all the dependencies installed in the project.
To run the application you need to invoke scripts from package.json
