props and hooks.

To make a git repository , refer crete new peoject video from hitesh choudary react course.
Once you make a repo , you need to intialise git , make a commit , change branch , then make a remote origin and push to that origin.

Theres two ways to create react-app , 
1) npx create-react-app appname , this takes a lot of time.
2) npm create vite@latest  , (vite is a bundler) (also you have to install each thing from here , to do that do npm i)

package.json file is the heart of the project , here you can check all the dependencies installed in the project.
To run the application you need to invoke scripts from package.json

To run cra : npm run start
To run vite : npm run dev

In cra , react scripts are present in dependencies and are excecuted when npm start takes place. html does not have <script> tag.
In vite , a <script> tag is present inside html where react is passed into html.

NOTE: cmd + shift + p to reload and remove import errors.

Javascript :
    createElement to create an element.
    innerHTML to add text.
    setAttribute(name, value) to change features for ex : href and target.
    appendChild()

React is all about designing and creating components and using them to create a web page.

JSX makes it possible for us to write html inside of react.

How does React.createElement work ?
    const element = createElement(type, props, ...children)
     it acepts paraeters in the order typeOfElement , Attributes , Children
     const atestElement2 = React.createElement (
        'a',
        {href : "https://www.google.com", target : "_blank"},
        'Clicke here lol'
    )
    type must be in string , attributes must be in {a:b}

if you are creating an element out of scratch as objects, and there is no need to extract anything out of an element tag , then
you do not have to use capital letters to call your function in ViteReact.
if you are returning an html element , then the things inside the html tag needs to be extracted hence , the function must begin 
with a capital letter.

Conclusion : basically all the html tags are converted into objects by React (refer React.createElement)

What is react State ?
